# 2019-Battlecode-Bot
This repo contains our team's bot entry into the 2019 battlecode competition.

The bots live in the bots directory. Our bot will be in bots/mainbot/
All other directories in bots/ will be used to create testing bots to play against.

The files are separated out by robot type. For example, castles, crusaders and pilgrims will all have their own files.
The logic for what a crusader should do on its turn will be in the crusader.js file.
The robot.js file will exist to determine which type of robot is taking a turn and pass control to that file.
